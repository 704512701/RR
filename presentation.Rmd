## Research question

- What is the performance result of **industry momentum strategy** in China's stock market according to the Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)?

- Concepts explanation:

- **momentum strategy:** Momentum investing is a system of buying stocks or other securities that have had high returns over the past three to twelve months, and selling those that have had poor returns over the same period. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_investing)

- **industry momentum strategy:** buy stocks from past winning industries and sell stocks from past losing industries. (Do Industries Explain Momentum? Tobias J. Moskowitz and Mark Grinblatt, 1999)


## Introduction

- What is the industry momentum strategy according to Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)?

- According to their strategy, we can build the investment portfolio by holding the stock portfolio with excellent short-term return **(3 to 12 month, “winner” portfolio)** and selling the stock portfolio with poor short-term return **(3 to 12 month, “loser” portfolio)**, so as to obtain considerable excess return.

- Why industry momentum strategy works?

- Industry momentum effect is a certain trend. The historical outstanding performance of the industry will **continue to maintain a high rate of return** over the next period of time, and historical poor performance of the industry will continue to **maintain the low yields** over the next period of time. If the industry momentum effect exists, it is possible to build industry momentum trading strategy by **holding a “winners” and “losers”**, in order to obtain excess returns.

## Data

- In our research, we adopt Shenwan industry classification standard (Shenyin Wanguo Securities Research Institute industry classification standard). all China’s stock market listed companies are divided into 31 specific industries.

- On this basis, this research selects the daily close price from January 1, 2005 to January 1, 2021, with a total of 832 weeks in sixteen years.

- The Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index (CSI 300) as the market benchmark index.

## Method

- Brief introduction:
  - This strategy is that selects stocks on the basis of returns over the past **J months** and holds them for **K months** (we will refer to this as a J-month/K-month strategy).
  - At the beginning of each month t the securities are ranked in ascending order on the basis of their returns in the past J months.
  - Based on these rankings, ten decile portfolios are formed that equally weight the stocks contained in the top decile, the second decile, and so on. The top decile portfolio is called the **“winners” decile** and the bottom decile is called the **“losers” decile**.
  - In each month t, the strategy buys the winner portfolio and sells the loser portfolio, holding this position for K months.
  - The sample industries with the "winner portfolio" of the industry and the "loser portfolio" of the industry are given **the same weight**. The **transaction cost** is 0.13%.
  - To be specific, all China’s stock market listed companies are divided into **31 specific industries** according to Shenwan class industry classification standard, so we regard the industry portfolio with **the top three** returns as the "winners" of the industry, and the industry portfolio with **the bottom three** returns as the "losers" of the industry.

## Method(con't)

- J-month/K-month strategy:
  - Select a certain length of time interval as the observation period of industry stock portfolio, and record it as J.
  - According to the rate of return of each industry index in the observation period J, the industry "winner portfolio" (W) and the industry "loser portfolio" (L) are constructed by the tenth method.
  - After the observation period J is determined, a certain time interval is taken as the holding period of "winner portfolio" and "loser portfolio", which is recorded as K. Accordingly, this trading strategy is recorded as strategy (J, K).

## Method(con't)

- Data processing:
  - There are three different operations for “winner” and “loser”, which are **long, short, and long-short**. 
  - Use (3,6) strategy as an example.

## Method(con't)

- Data processing:
  - We will have **whole period return, annual return, whole period maximum drawdown and annual maximum drawdown**.
  - Use long strategy as an example. (See Table)

## Method(con't)

- Data processing:
  - We will have the graph **for long, short, long-short, and CSI 300 Index monthly returns**.
  - Use (3,3) strategy as an example.

## Results of Return(For long)

- Excess return for long:
  - we can clearly see that **buying "winners"** can obtain significant excess returns.

## Results of Return(For short)

- Excess return for short:
  - we can clearly see that **selling “losers”** can not obtain significant excess returns.

## Results of Maximum Drawdown 

- What is a Maximum Drawdown (MDD)?
  - A maximum drawdown (MDD) is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period.

  - The Formula for Maximum Drawdown:
$$MDD = \frac{Trough\quad Value - Peak\quad Value}{Peak\quad Value}$$

## Results of Maximum Drawdown(For long)

- Maximum drawdown for long:
  - we can clearly see that **buying “winners”** has an relatively stable maximum drawdown compare to CSI 300.

-Maximum drawdown for long-short:
  - we can clearly see that **buying “winners” and selling “losers”** has an relatively low maximum drawdown compare to CSI 300.

## Conclusion

- Buying “winners” can obtain more than 10% of the excess return. In addition, the trading strategy to obtain the highest excess return is (1,1).

- Selling “losers” can not obtain any excess return. People will lose almost everything by short them.

- Buying “winners” and selling “losers” can not obtain any excess return as well.

- Buying “winners” have an relatively stable maximum drawdown compare to CSI 300, while selling “losers” has an relatively high maximum drawdown compared to CSI 300.

- Buying “winners” and selling “losers” has an relatively low maximum drawdown compare to CSI 300.
